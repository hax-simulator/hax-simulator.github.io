## Development environment

For developing Hax data centers, the recommended tool is the [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org) platform with the [GroovyEclipse](https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki) plugin installed. 
You will also need to download the HaxFramework Eclipse project from [here](https://sites.google.com/site/haxsimulator/), and add it to your Eclipse workspace. 
After that, see the README.md file of the HaxFramework project on how to proceed.
